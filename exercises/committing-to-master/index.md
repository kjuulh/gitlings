# Committing to master

## Introduction

This exercise is about working on branches locally, and by mistake committing changes to a branch, when not intending to.

## Situation

You are currently working on a feature and by mistake have forgotten that you're working directly on master. What you want is to move the commit to a branch and continue working.
